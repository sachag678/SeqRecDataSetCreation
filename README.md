# CoSeRec

This repository contains the code used to perform EDA and clean and transform of the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/elo-merchant-category-recommendation/data)
that contains credit card purchases at particular merchants. This data can be used to generated a dataset with card_id and a sequence of purchases represented by
merchant ids. This dataset is ideal for the contrastive sequential reccomendation task.
